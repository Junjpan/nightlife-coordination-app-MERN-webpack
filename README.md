# nightlife-coordination-app-MERN-webpack

This is a responsive free app. You can use this app to find information on bars and eateries w/ bars (such as addresses,phone numbers, ratings etc.) for any cities in the US. There are additional and interactive functions if you become a member of the app.
These functions include a comments section and a 'find the location' function using Google maps. The coolest thing about this app is that each bar has their own chat room. People can go inside the bar chat room to ask information regarding the bar or additional information. I call it 'live review.' 

_**Currently the login with facebook button only works for the owner of the app because the app has not been reviewed by facebook which causes facebook API usage limitations
