# nightlife-coordination-app-MERN-webpack

This is a responsive free app. You can use this app to find information on bars and eatiers w/ bars (such as address,phone number, rating etc) for any cities in the US. There are additional and interactive functions if you are a member of the app.
These functions include a comments section and a 'find the location' function using Google maps. The coolest thing about this app is that each bar has their own chat room. People can go inside the 
bar chat room to ask information regarding the bar or additional information. I call it 'live review.' Curenttly the login with facebook 
button only work for me because the app has not been review by facebook yet.

Main technical environment: React,webpack,node.js/express.js/,Socket.io,Mongodb/mongoose,css,html,axios,node-fetch, google javascript web API
,Yelp API and facebook login API

This app is delployed at https://jbnightlifeapp.herokuapp.com/
